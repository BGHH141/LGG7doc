# How to install the korean Android 9 update on any LG G7 device

##Instro

This guide does not require an unlocked bootloader, but this measure also does not  allow you to root your phone more than on oreo.

##Disclaimer
Even though this is an update package officially released by LG, there is a tiny tiny chance that your phone could turn into a brick. I'm not responsible for any damage to the device, PC or any other device related to the things explained in this guide. YOU are doing this.

##getting the required files
The following things are required:
- [LG bridge or LG driver package](https://www.lg.com/de/support/software-firmware?search=G7&pageVisibleFlag=2)
- LGUP dev version 1.15.06
- the korean pie update file: `G710N20c_00_LGU_KR_OP_0107`
- a Windows PC
- a USB type C cable for connection

##Procedure
At first you need to install the LG USB drivers and the LGUP software.
After that you turn off the phone and put it into download mode. This mode differs from the fastboot or recovery mode. You can enter it by pressing the vol+ button (not the power button!) whilst plugging the USB type C cable into the phone.
If you did it correctly, the phone's screen will light up and indicate that it is in download mode.
Now you start the device manager and open up the `COM & LPT` category. The phone should show up and a COM number should be displayed You will require that later.
As this version of lgup requires a login, it's only possible to use the cmd variant:
